### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Farzad Yousefi. I graduated in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Mazandaran University- Behshahr. I am proud to have been included in the team behind the article: Gurkirt Singh - ROAD: The Road Event Awareness Dataset for Autonomous Driving 2021 -Publisher: IEEE. I prefer to share whatever I have learned so we can learn together. If you think my cooperation is beneficial, feel free to contact me, I would be happy to provide it.
